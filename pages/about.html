<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
  My name is Lewis Combes (pronounced as though it has two "o"s, though it does not). For the last four years I have been studying for my PhD at the University of Sheffield under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mhaluksengun/"> Haluk Şengün</a>. I am due to complete my PhD soon, and am on the job market.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of my research, I am interested in mathematical culture, how we organise knowledge and research, what it means to understand something, and new ways to communicate mathematics to as wide an audience as possible. In my experience, the best a mathematician can hope for when discussing their research with non-mathematicians is polite interest that doesn't extend beyond the basic concepts. People are afraid of maths! This is invariably disappointing, and I'm passionate about finding ways to explain what mathematicians do all day to the general public without needing them to have taken four years of undergraduate courses to get anything out of it.
</p>

<p>
  I am also interested in literature, music, television; art in general.
</p>

<p>
  I have a number of coding projects outside of strict mathematics research (although mathematics often sneaks in all the same). These can be found at <a href="https://github.com/arctanpi">a different GitHub account</a>.
