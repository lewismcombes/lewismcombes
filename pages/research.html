<h1> Research </h1>
<p>My current research project focuses on computing Selmer groups associated to Galois representations coming from the mod p cohomology of Bianchi groups. It is not done yet.</p>

<a href="../downloads/research/mathematics_of_bitcoin_ecdsa_lmc.pdf" <h3><i>Mathematics of Bitcoin: The ECDSA</i> (University of Warwick, 2018)</h3></a>
<p>My Masters thesis investigates the theory underlying elliptic curve encryption, including some background on discrete logarithms, general attacks on elliptic curve encryption, and how these apply to the curve used in verifying Bitcoin transactions, Secp256k1. I think it is broadly free of mathematical errors, although I have not thought about the ECDSA in some time, and corrections are gratefully receieved! It is likely riddled with bad Tex practice. </p>
